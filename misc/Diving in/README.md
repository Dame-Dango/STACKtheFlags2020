## Solution
1. We are given torn pieces of paper to attempt to reconstruct the text

2. ...or I can be lazy and reconstruct only the things that looks like a flag. So I used Paint.NET's magic wand to select the pieces that look interesting.

3. And paste it on a new picture with a black background.

4. After finding all the required pieces, we get the flag!
