## Solution

The orgnisation we are suppose to hunt for is "KoroVax". With a bit of Google Hacking, I was able to find their website: `korovax.org`.

The addenum mentioned about a sitemap, which led to us trying [`/sitemap.xml`](http://korovax.org/sitemap.xml), which presented us all the pages that this website has. It seems that this website can also be visited using `https://csgctf.wordpress.com/`.

Out of all the pages, there was one page at [`/oh-ho/`](https://korovax.org/oh-ho/) that led to our next clue: 

![](ohho.png)

The underlined "social media" was linked to what seems to be [Facebook replica](http://fb.korovax.org)?

Going back to the [`/oh-ho/`](https://korovax.org/oh-ho/) page, we need to first figure out who might have written this page and search their Twitter for their password.

There was another page at [`/2020/10/21/new-tool-i-found/`](http://korovax.org/2020/10/21/new-tool-i-found/)

Sarah Miller was writing about a new tool she discovered called [`Twitter Archiver`](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/tweet_archiver/976886281542). The [`/oh-ho/`](http://korovax.org/oh-ho/) page did talk about archived tweets, hence the person we need to search up is probably Sarah Miller.

There were many Sarah Millers on Twitter, making it very difficult to drill down into the correct account. Fortunately, one of our team members found her Twitter handle [`@scba`](https://twitter.com/scba) by chance when reviewing the other pages on the [website](https://korovax.org/2020/10/01/example-post-3/).

The [`/oh-ho/`](https://korovax.org/oh-ho/) page did mention about `blue..something...communication`, so lets use the words `blue` and `communications` and do a search on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=blue%20communications%20(from%3Ascba)&src=typed_query&f=live).

![](twitter.png)

Maybe the password is `Blue sky communications`? According to the the [organisation website](http://korovax.org/team/), her email was `sarahmiller@korovax.org`. With her email and password, we were able to login to her account on the [Facebook replica](http://fb.korovax.org)!
